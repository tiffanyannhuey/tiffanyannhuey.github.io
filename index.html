<h1>Cool Places for the Wanderer</h1>
  <p> This website is to give you a glimpse of all the fun and interesting places to visit when you're in San Diego. I've lived here for almost 10 years and am continuously finding new places to eat, see, and visit. Below are some of my favorites 
  </p>
<h2>Top Places To Eat</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Salud Tacos:</strong> San Diego is a hub of amazing Mexican food and this place, located in the Barrio Logan neighborhood, tops the rest. They have fresh tortillas and amazing carne asade and fish tacos. But beware, the line can be up to an hour wait, especially on Taco Tuesday</li>
    <li><strong>Underbelly: </strong>I have to admit, I always thought of ramen as the cheap $0.10 meal from your college days. But Underbelly is one of the first (and still the best) gourmet ramen spots. It's my go-to place when we experience any sort of cold weather.</li>
    <li><strong>Cafe Bleu: </strong>Brunch is serious business, and my all-time favorite meal. Although this isn't purely known for being a "breakfast spot" you can't beat their unique and delicious menu, in combination with free tartin (french baguette and strawberry wine reduction). It also is a hidden gem in the heart of Mission Hills. While it seems like every breakfast spot has a two-hour wait, I can always just walk in here and find a table. My favorite meal? The French Toast ermagawd.</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Top Places to Hike</h2>
  <p>San Diego has no shortage of hiking locations, with hundreds of miles of trails around San Diego county. Since everyone has varying degrees of hiking ability, here's a quick chart of cool hikes by difficulty level</p>

<h2>Road Trips</h2>
<p>Everything in southern California is so close to each other, so there are several options when it comes getting out of the city. Each of these places are within a few hours of San Diego</p>
<h3>Arroya Tapiado Mud Caves - Anza Borrego Desert</h3>
<p>These mud caves were carved from millions of years of rainwater. You can even find fossils if you look hard enough. If you go to these caves, I <em>highly</em> recommend getting a vehicle with 4-wheel drive and some headgear with sufficient lighting.</p>
<h3>Salvation Mountain and East Jesus</h3>

<p>This mountain is out of a Dr. Seuss book - it was painted by Leonard Knight as a devotion to his "love of God."</p>
<h3>Catalina Islands</h3>
<p>These islands are the perfect getaway from city life. It's mostly unpopulated and has pristine waters and plenty of wildlife. The most populous of the wildlife are the island foxes - these creatures will show up at night around your campsite for a good view. In addition, there is a herd of buffalo around the island. They were brought to Catalina to film a Western movie, and were left there as it was too expensive to take them back. They're very cool to look at but beware of getting too close.</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>As much as I would like to say that I found all of this on my own, I found a lot of these adventures through <a href="http://hiddensandiego.net/" target="blank"> Hidden San Diego</a> I usually use this site as a go-to when I'm looking for new things to do. If you check it out, there are a TON of places here that I haven't mentioned that are definitely worth a visit.</p>
